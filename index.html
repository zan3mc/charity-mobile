        <h2>What is Bundle Up? </h2>
        <p class="info">Bundle Up is a non-profit organization whose only purpose is to insure as many underprivileged children in underserved communities have access to winter clothes. No one deserves to be cold during the winter, especially children. Last year alone we provided over 10 thousand winter coats and apparel  to children living in poverty.</p>

        <h2>How to Donate.</h2>
        <p class="info">When it comes to donating it depends on what you are donating. If you are wanting to make a cash donation you can do so by donating it at one of our in person events. All the money donated is used to buy extra supplies for our events. You can also donate toward the bundles,(hats, gloves, winter coats, scarves and/or blankets) also at the in person events. All items donated will be sorted and eventually given away to a child in need. </p>
